***Hey there!!*** 👋🏻

I'm ***Anshika Chhabra***, an undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering. 👧🏻💻

- 📖  I'm currently learning C, C++, DSA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & the list goes on!! 
 Yeah, there's a lot on my plate but I believe that I would be happy being a learner for life as long as I keep encountering skills & concepts that are worth learning!!
